<br>***PRINCIPAL IOT SECURITY ARCHITECT AND RESEARCHER***<br>
*Cloud Security, Architecture, Analytics & Compliance, IOT Design and
Audit*

I have helped companies attack modern IOT problems in Azure. I bring an out-of-the-box creative and technically sound perspective to my clients. I serve as their guide, explaining difficult technical problems clearly. I help them make the best choices based upon their needs. All IOT devices should be secure and safe. They should help businesses bring secure solutions to their clients. Customers' data needs to be private, and still usable, within an increasingly complex international
regulatory environment. An open mind is key to having a good working relationship with my colleagues and customers.

## <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Professional Experience</span>

**Cree Incorporated, Durham, North Carolina July 2016 to May 2018**

***Principal IOT Security Researcher***<br>
Develop new IOT security product. This included cloud, on-prem, and device security. Also developed secure development pipeline for device and cloud asset updating, and developed a signed openwrt image for final release to manufacturing. Evaluated multiple IOT infrastructure (thingworx, Microsoft Azure IOT, Renesys) platforms. 

*Selected Achievements:*

-   Crafted a custom hybrid IOT infrastructure that delivered micro-services to customers. The solution including research, documentation, testing, and final deployment including the development of a custom Secure RedHat OS on Hyper-V. This served as the template for final VM introduction to the Azure Marketplace. Combined both Unix (Ansible) and Windows (azure cli) tools to automate this process.

-   Created a fully automatic pipeline using secure package signing, binary asset management, and deployment to secure web servers. This was used to update all cloud and IOT assets securely. Developed highly resistant signing architecture to ensure that all assets were safe an untampered.

-   Developed secure PKI implementation which combined security with functionality. We used RSA keys with a hardware anchor of trust to make security based upon physical characteristics of IOT devices. This made data opaque to adversaries, and complied with local and international laws. All data transmissions were protected from viewing or tampering using industry standard RSA 4096 Bit encryption, TLS 1.2 ECDHE keys with custom moduli, and with automatic rekeying every hour.
